# Sudoku

This repository includes the file to be run to play the sudoku game. I created the project using PyCharm and the actual game can be run through that. 

The game is set on medium difficulty and has the same amount of given numbers each time it is played. Before each game the board is randomized so you won't get the same game twice in a row (probably).
